# myshell: Creation of a bash-inspired shell using C, C++, Lex, and Yacc

## Getting started
- Clone the repository to a Linux machine with Python3 and g++ installed.
- Run `make` in the home directory to compile the shell binary `shell.o`
- Run `chmod +x shell` to enable execution privileges
- Optional: enter the `test-shell` directory and run `chmod +x *` to enable testing scripts, and run `testall` in the testing directory to run test suite.
